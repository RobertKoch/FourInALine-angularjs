FourInALine-angularjs
=====================

Four in a line with angular.js

A Project for the master course Client-Side Web Engineering (MMT, University of Applied Sciences Salzburg)

Usage:

The project was created with the yeoman generator for angular.
It includes grunt, bower, karma and angular with dependencies.
We did not built our own node-server, so you only can play on one pc against your friends.

To run the project call:

1) npm install
2) grunt

"grunt" will build a distribution to /dist an create a server on localhost:9000 to run the project from the dist-directory.
Use "grunt server" for a deployment environment with live reload and so on.
Once you created a distribution, you can use "grunt server:dist" to create a server using the deployed version in the /dist folder.
